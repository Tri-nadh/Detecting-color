# Detecting-color
This repository have a jupyter notebook that contain code to detect and give Hex code of the selected color.
1. This project is done with the help of OpenCV and pandas libraries.
2. I started the project by reading Image in which I need to detect colours and the CSV file that contains information about the Hex code of the colours.
3. After that, I defined two functions that get the names of the colours from the CSV file.
4. Finally, I have created a separate window that displays the name and (R, G, B) values of the colour according to the mouse pointer.1.
